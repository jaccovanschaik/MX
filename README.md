# MX

## Introduction

MX is a light-weight communication library written in C. It provides
programs that use it with a way to publish and subscribe to messages.
There is no predetermined structure to the payload of a message. To MX,
a message payload is a simple, opaque byte string. In addition to a C
interface there is also a Python binding.
